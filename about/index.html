        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Elliptic Curve Lab</strong> is a long-term research program focused on understanding
            the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). We study the mathematical structures
            underlying elliptic curve cryptography — with special attention to the secp256k1 curve used
            in Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Our goal is not to break real-world cryptography.</strong> Instead, we seek deep
            mathematical understanding: Why is ECDLP so hard? What makes $O(\sqrt{n})$ the barrier?
            Are there hidden structures that could — in theory — be exploited?
        </p>

        <h2>The Fundamental Question</h2>
        <p>
            After decades of research, no classical algorithm can solve ECDLP on a general curve
            faster than $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the group order. For a 256-bit curve, this means
            roughly $2^{128} \approx 3.4 \times 10^{38}$ operations — completely infeasible.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ask: <strong>Why?</strong> Is there a deeper geometric or algebraic reason? Can we
            formulate no-go theorems that explain this barrier? Or is there some overlooked structure
            that could provide a shortcut?
        </p>

        <h2>What We Study</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Curve models:</strong> Weierstrass, Montgomery, Edwards, and their computational trade-offs</li>
            <li><strong>Isogenies:</strong> Mappings between curves and their security implications</li>
            <li><strong>Endomorphisms:</strong> GLV optimization, complex multiplication, automorphism groups</li>
            <li><strong>Attack algorithms:</strong> Pollard's rho, Pohlig-Hellman, index calculus, MOV attack</li>
            <li><strong>Special structures:</strong> Curves with $j$-invariant 0, CM curves, embedding degree</li>
            <li><strong>Theoretical limits:</strong> Lower bounds, generic group model, no-go arguments</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Research Values</h2>

        <h3>Formal Correctness</h3>
        <p>
            Every claim is backed by rigorous mathematical proof or clear justification. We don't
            speculate — we prove, or we say we don't know.
        </p>

        <h3>Reproducible Experiments</h3>
        <p>
            We develop algorithm prototypes, measure their performance, and publish all code.
            Anyone can verify our results and build upon them.
        </p>

        <h3>Negative Results Are Valuable</h3>
        <p>
            When an approach doesn't work, we document exactly why it failed. Systematic refutation
            of dead ends is part of our mission — it saves others from repeating the same mistakes.
        </p>

        <h3>Open Science</h3>
        <p>
            All outputs — research reports, blog articles, source code — are freely available.
            This supports credibility and enables collaboration.
        </p>

        <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
        <p>
            This is not a single paper or a quick project. We aim to systematically map the entire
            "space of possible speedups" for ECDLP — every known technique, every theoretical limit,
            every dead end. The goal is to understand, once and for all, what makes this problem hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we find that no sub-$\sqrt{n}$ breakthrough is possible, we want to explain why
            convincingly. If we discover something new — even impractical — it advances our
            understanding of one of cryptography's most important problems.
        </p>
