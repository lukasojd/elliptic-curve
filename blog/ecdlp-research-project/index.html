        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Elliptic curves are one of the pillars of modern cryptography. The
security of many systems—including Bitcoin—rests on the difficulty of
the so-called <strong>Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem
(ECDLP)</strong>.</p>
<p>Formally, given a base point <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>
on an elliptic curve and a public point <span class="math display">\[Q =
[d]G\]</span> for some unknown integer <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, the task is to recover the value of
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. For sufficiently large
parameters, this problem is considered computationally intractable: no
known classical (non-quantum) algorithm can solve ECDLP on a general
curve in time polynomial in <span class="math inline">\(\log n\)</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the group order.</p>
<p>The best known generic approach, <strong>Pollard’s rho
algorithm</strong>, has time complexity on the order of <span
class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{n})\)</span>. For the 256-bit curve
secp256k1, this means roughly <span class="math inline">\(2^{128}
\approx 3.4 \times 10^{38}\)</span> group operations—completely beyond
the capabilities of current hardware.</p>
<p>In other words, breaking a 256-bit key through brute force or generic
algorithms is practically impossible. Any potential attack must exploit
some special structure of the curve or additional information.</p>
<h1 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h1>
<p>Our project does not aim to practically break the cryptography of
Bitcoin or other systems. Instead, we seek a <strong>deeper mathematical
understanding of ECDLP</strong>—we want to explore why this problem is
so difficult and what structures, algorithms, or models it conceals.</p>
<p>The main goal is to extend theoretical knowledge of ECDLP over
elliptic curves, with special attention to secp256k1. We are not looking
for practical vulnerabilities for immediate attacks on real
cryptosystems; rather, we are interested in the <strong>mathematical
essence of the problem</strong>.</p>
<p>We examine a wide range of aspects of elliptic curves and discrete
logarithms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Classical curve models</strong>: Weierstrass, Edwards,
Montgomery, and others</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isogenies</strong>: mappings between curves and their
computational implications</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Arithmetic methods</strong>: efficient algorithms for
point operations</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automorphisms</strong>: internal symmetries and their
exploitation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Special structures</strong>: curves with <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-invariant 0, complex multiplication
(CM)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to describe and unify knowledge about all known—and
lesser-known—layers of ECDLP: how different models and coordinate
systems affect computational complexity, how curves can be transformed
via isogenies, what endomorphisms exist and how they can speed up
computations, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, the secp256k1 curve, thanks to complex multiplication
(the so-called <strong>Gallant–Lambert–Vanstone endomorphism</strong>),
allows scalar multiplication implementations to be accelerated by
approximately 30%. However, an attacker can exploit the same advantage,
so this special structure does not compromise security by itself. This
improves constant factors but does not change the asymptotic hardness of
ECDLP. (The SafeCurves project notes it as a potential risk for a
possible future breakthrough, but no attack exploiting this additional
structure is currently known.)</p>
<p>Our project systematically examines all such possibilities and limits
of ECDLP on elliptic curves—the aim is to leave nothing out and get to
the core of the problem.</p>
<h1 id="research-values">Research Values</h1>
<p>We emphasize <strong>formal correctness and proofs</strong>. Every
claim is supported by rigorous mathematical argumentation—instead of
speculation, we provide proofs or clear justification.</p>
<p>At the same time, we conduct <strong>reproducible
experiments</strong>: we develop and publish algorithm prototypes,
measure their performance on real data, and make results available to
the community.</p>
<p><strong>Negative results are just as important as positive
ones</strong>—systematic refutation of dead ends is part of the project.
If some attack direction or optimization does not lead to the goal, we
thoroughly document why it failed so others can learn from it.</p>
<p>All outputs will be openly published for the community—in the form of
research reports, blog articles, and freely available code in
repositories. This <strong>open-source and open-science
approach</strong> is meant to support the credibility of results and
enable others to build upon them.</p>
<h1 id="where-we-are-heading">Where We Are Heading</h1>
<p>In the longer term, we ask the question: <strong>what constitutes the
“fundamental barrier” of ECDLP?</strong></p>
<p>Why, after decades of research, do we not know a classical algorithm
significantly faster than <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span>?
Is there some deeper geometric or algebraic reason why ECDLP is so
resistant to speedup?</p>
<p>In our project, we try to map the “space of all possible
speedups”—that is, all known approaches to potentially facilitate
solving the discrete logarithm. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Traditional methods</strong>: Pohlig–Hellman
decomposition for groups with easily factorable order, index calculus in
various variants, exploitation of small embedding degree via MOV attack,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New and less explored ideas</strong>: use of summation
polynomials, search for special curve parameterizations, machine
learning over point structures, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We are interested in whether there is a chance for a
<strong>sub-<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span>
breakthrough</strong>—an algorithm that would solve ECDLP faster than
<span class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{n})\)</span>—and, if not, why such a
breakthrough apparently does not exist.</p>
<p>We will investigate whether geometric transformations (isogenies,
special projections) or algebraic properties (complex multiplication,
special points with low order, higher automorphisms) could provide an
unexpected shortcut to a solution.</p>
<p>If we conclude that no fundamental speedup is possible, we want to be
able to explain this convincingly—ideally formulating conditions or
<strong>no-go theorems</strong> that exclude such a sub-<span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> breakthrough. Conversely, if we
discover a new curve model, a new type of arithmetic, or a new
attack—even if currently impractical—it will be a valuable advance in
understanding the problem.</p>
<p>This is a long-term research program rather than a single result. Our
aim is to document every step—ideas that work, ideas that fail, and the
boundary between what seems mathematically possible and impossible for
ECDLP.</p>
<h1 id="output-style">Output Style</h1>
<p>Project outputs will be prepared to be <strong>valuable to experts
while accessible to the broader public</strong> interested in
mathematics and cryptography.</p>
<p>Each topic will be examined in depth—first theoretically (including
formal proofs), then experimentally (algorithm verification,
measurements, demonstrations), and finally summarized in an
understandable form.</p>
<p>We plan to prepare not only technical reports but also more popular
articles (e.g., on this blog) that explain even complex concepts in a
readable and illustrative way. The writing style emphasizes readability:
we highlight important ideas, use clear text structure, graphs, and
examples.</p>
<p>We want not only cryptographic experts but also motivated readers
from the broader community to take away insights from our materials.
This project has the ambition to <strong>inspire</strong>—to show the
beauty hidden in the mathematics of elliptic curves and to stimulate
further research at the intersection of algebraic number theory,
geometry, and cryptography.</p>
